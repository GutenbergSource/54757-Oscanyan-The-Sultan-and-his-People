<HTML><BODY>A description of the Ottoman empire by the Armenian journalist and author Hachik Oscanyan, who also wrote in Armenian and Turkish (in Armenian script). He was the Turkish consul-general in New York from 1868 to 1874.

<p>The book is a description of the Turkish empire, mostly serious, but at times almost satirical, and includes several funny observations.

<p>No particular problems expected. The book is a Google scan, but complete, and another volunteer here at PGDP has located an original copy to obtain better quality illustrations from.

<p>Take care of the numbers 3, 5, and 8. They are often confused by the OCR.

<p>Furthermore, the OCR has sometimes dropped the last word of the page (due to curvature in the scan); please do a double check in the lower-right corner of the page.

<p>Have fun!
